# A List of Podcast Episodes to Learn Something New

I have many interests, but this list is oriented toward **tech, business, education, and general personal improvement**.

Episodes are being added to the list as I listen to them, so there is not a particular ranking. 

The **"Notes"** column on the table will take you to a detailed review of the podcast episode in **Spanish** on my [personal website](https://alangarciamuniz.com). 

I'm always open to new recommendations; let me know if you have listened to something cool lately! ðŸ˜Ž
